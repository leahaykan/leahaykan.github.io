        </div>
<div> 
        <p>
Fact 1: <strong style= 'color: red;'>DIAMONDS</strong>, aka "Blood Diamonds", in the past two decades, seven African countries have endured brutal civil conflicts fueled by diamonds: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola, the Republic of Congo, the Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.(1)
            </p>
    <p>Fact 2: <strong style= 'color: red;'>OIL</strong> and <strong style= 'color: red;'> NATURAL GAS</strong>, aka "Black Gold", the world's two most valuable traded resources and probably the most conflict-prone. Exxon, Shell, Total, and Lukoil, the world's top companies in the sector, roam the planet in search of new reserves, often generating wars and civil conflicts as they vie (with help from their governments) for control of the hugely profitable fields.(2)
            </p>

<p>
    Fact 3: <strong style= 'color: red;'>WATER</strong> Only 2.5% of the worlds total water volume is fresh water. Of that 2.5%, 70% is frozen. The depletion of our water resources is more serious that the current oil depletion. There are substitutes for oil but nothing can replace our drinking water. 70% of the available fresh water that remains in used in agriculture, 20% in industry and only 10% is being used for human consumption.(3)
            </p>
            
<p>
    Fact 4:  <strong style= 'color: red;'>WOOD</strong> is considered humankind's very first source of energy. An estimated 18 million acres of forests are destroyed each year. Half of the worlds forest has been cleared. Deforestation contributes 12 to 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. Trees absorb greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide. They produce the oxygen we breathe. Forests are the habitats of millions of species.(4)
